## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze the sales performance of a retail franchise operating across multiple branches.
The dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of key business metrics such as revenue, quantity sold, unit cost, unit price, and profit.

It helps business owners understand where the company is performing well and where improvements are needed by breaking insights down across product categories, branches, sales channels, payment methods, discounts, customer loyalty, and shipping costs.

- Which branch generates the highest sales?
- Which product category generates the highest revenue?
- Which product model performs best?
- Which months or days record the highest sales?
- Which sales channel performs better: online or in-store?
- Which payment method is most preferred by customers?
- Does offering discounts increase the quantity purchased?
- Do returning (loyal) customers spend more than non-loyal customers?
- Does shipping cost affect profitability?

### Project Insights: 
**1. Revenue and Profit Overview**
- Total Revenue: 112 million
- Total Profit: 27 million

The business is operating profitably across all product categories. However, higher shipping costs are associated with glower average profit, indicating that shipping expenses have a negative impact on profit margins.

**2. Product Performance**
- Electronics is the highest-performing product category in both revenue and profit.
- Apple smartphones are the top-performing product model within the electronics category.
- Dell and HP laptops also show strong performance.
- Home appliances demonstrate moderate performance.
- Products such as toys and books contribute relatively less to overall profit.

**3. Seasonality (Revenue by Month)**
- March recorded the highest revenue at 42.3 million.
- January followed closely with 41.7 million.
- February recorded the lowest sales among the three months.

This suggests the presence of seasonal buying patterns.

**4. Payment Methods and Sales Channels**
- Credit cards are the most frequently used payment method.
- In-store purchases slightly outperform online sales, although the difference is minimal.

**5. Discounts and Customer Loyalty**
- Higher discounts did not result in higher sales volume, as products sold without discounts recorded the highest quantity sold.
- Non-loyal customers contribute slightly more to total revenue (53.4%) compared to loyal customers (46.6%), indicating an opportunity to improve customer retention strategies.
